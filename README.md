## tmplfn package

_tmplfn_ package provides an additional set of common functions 
(e.g. standardized date formatting) to use with Go's text/template 
and html/template packages.

It is also possible to use tmplfn to create filters for data records
based on the pipeline that would be passed to an _if_ clause in a text
template.
